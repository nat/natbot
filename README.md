Drive a browser with GPT-3 or [Text-Generator.io](https://text-generator.io)

Here's a demo: https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1575631194032549888

Lots of ideas for improvement:
- Better prompt
- Prompt chaining
- Make a recorder to collect human feedback and do better few-shot
- Better DOM serialization
- Let the agent use multiple tabs and switch between them

Improvements welcome!
